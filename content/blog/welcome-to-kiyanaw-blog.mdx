# Welcome to the kiyânaw Blog

tânisi! Welcome to the kiyânaw blog. I'm excited to share this new space where we can connect more deeply with our community of language learners and supporters.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will be a place to share:

- **Project updates** - Behind-the-scenes looks at how we're building tools like kiyânaw Transcribe, the kiyânaw Database, and our upcoming mobile app
- **Learning stories** - Experiences from the community about language learning journeys, challenges, and victories
- **Resource highlights** - Deep dives into items from our Learner Library and how to make the most of them
- **Technical insights** - For those interested in the technology behind our language tools

## Our Mission Continues

As adult language learners, we often need to take our language learning journey into our own hands. That's why we're building this bundle of tools and resources - to support each other in this important work.

Whether you're just starting your language learning journey or you've been at it for years, this blog is for you. We'll share practical tips, celebrate progress, and explore the intersection of technology and Indigenous language revitalization.

## Stay Connected

We're just getting started with this blog, but we have lots of exciting content planned. Make sure to check back regularly, and as always, feel free to reach out with questions, suggestions, or stories you'd like to share.

kinanâskomitin - thank you for being part of this journey with us.
