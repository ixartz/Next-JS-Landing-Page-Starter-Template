# Building Language Tools for Community

When I first started learning nêhiyawêwin six years ago, I quickly realized that the tools available for adult learners were limited. Most resources were either too basic or too academic, leaving a gap for intermediate learners who wanted to engage with real, contemporary language use.

## The Challenge of Adult Language Learning

Learning an Indigenous language as an adult presents unique challenges:

- **Limited immersion opportunities** - Unlike learning French or Spanish, finding daily conversation partners can be difficult
- **Resource gaps** - Many excellent resources exist, but they're scattered across different platforms and formats
- **Technology barriers** - Existing language learning apps weren't designed with Indigenous languages in mind

## Community-First Development

From the beginning, we've approached tool development with community needs at the center. This means:

### Listening to Learners

Every feature in kiyânaw Transcribe came from real feedback from people using it to work with audio recordings. The deep-linking feature? That came from someone wanting to share a specific moment in a transcription with their language teacher.

### Building for Real Use Cases

The kiyânaw Database emerged from my own frustration trying to find examples of specific word forms in context. Instead of just creating word lists, we built a system that shows you how words are actually used in real recordings and texts.

### Keeping It Free

All our tools are free to use because language learning shouldn't be limited by financial barriers. Community contributions and donations help us keep the lights on while maintaining this commitment.

## What's Next

We're currently working on the kiyânaw mobile app, which will let learners collect and share phrases with audio using just their phone. The goal is to make it easy for any community to build their own phrase collection, regardless of technical expertise.

The feedback loop continues - we build, you use, you tell us what's missing, and we iterate. That's how we ensure these tools actually serve the community they're meant for.
